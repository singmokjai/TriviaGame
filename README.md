# TriviaGame

This trivia game was definitely one of the harder projects that I worked on. I had a problem where my trivia game wasn't rendering the questions properly and it was quite the nightmare. My true false buttons didn't work according to the circumstances I had wanted them to. Countless commits later, I found the problem. I always had the right idea but my code wasn't well organized. I also assigned the same IDs to multiple elements which gave me a huge problem. Those were the main reasons as to why I couldn't get things to work as they should. Eventually googling didn't help and I mainly got things to work after help from a course assistant. Nonetheless I gained superior knowledge from this project.
